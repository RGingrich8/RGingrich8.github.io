                    My name is Richard Gingrich and I am a graduate from the University of Calgary, recently obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
                    My areas of interest lie in web design, web security, and networking. I have provided some examples of my work on this page, and
                    am able to provide more upon request. 
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of work interests, I very much enjoy travelling and sports. It is a goal of mine to explore as much of this wonderful world as possible,
                    and it is important for me to feel as though I am contributing to making the world a better place. I want my work to grant something
                    of value, which will in turn help me to be fulfilled. 

                    I am a very passionate person and would love to hear back from you!

                        An application to that matches like-minded players for the game Valorant, 
                        a popular first-person shooter. The UI was created using REACT, while NodeJS and MongoDB were used
                        for handling the backend and allowing players to connect to one another.

                    <p>
                        Created in Python, a Discord bot that is capable of searching up song lyrics when given an artist name and song title. It will then
                        return statistics about the song, such as the most common words within the song, the total number of words, 
                        and how unique the lyrics are. 
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately deprecated after Discord's API update, but the code can be viewed and the bot may still be added to servers.

                    <p>
                        A demonstration of 3 common web attacks - cookie poisoning, cross-site scripting, and SQL injection. Informative pages provide background of 
                        each of the attacks, which were then recreated for the user to try for themselves. Please note that some modern browsers have built-in protections,
                        such as Chrome blocking any potential cross-site scripts by default. 
                        <br><br>
                        My role in this project was to create and showcase the scripting attacks, as well as how to safeguard a site from such intrusions.

                        An example of more technically challenging code, these C++ projects showcase threading, barriers,
                        and optimized code that can take massive inputs and return a result in under 10s. These files
                        are a great example of well-written and clearly documented code, and are a representation of the standard I hold myself to.
