            <p>To whom it may interest,

                My name is Richard Gingrich and I am a graduate from the University of Calgary, obtaining a BSc in Computer Science.
                
                I am passionate about (CPSC passions here). Web design (UI/UX) is something I have also dabbled in and have found to be quite 
                creative and enjoyable.
                Another thing I am passionate about is travel, and since my trip to Thailand in early 2023 it has been a dream of mine to move to and work (either remote or not) 
                in Thailand. For me, salary is not the most important aspect of my dream (replace???) job. Rather, it is most important to
                me that I feel like I am contributing something of value and working on projects that are fulfilling.
                In that sense, it is not the amount of money that is a deciding factor on my end. That is, I am willing to take a lower salary if ___
