	<h1> SQL Injection </h1>
	
	<!--
	The way I see this working on the website is we have the user type “’; SELECT * from passwords; –” or some similar query into two fields. One will allow the SQL to run and return some generic data. The other will sanitize the input so that the data does not show up.
	
	You guys will have to figure out what command you want the user to type in. That may require also updating the last part about what exactly you are doing. For instance, you might decide to use an OUTER JOIN or UNION instead of a new query.
	-->
	
	<h2> How to Exploit </h2>
	
	<p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which lets you access and manipulate databases. When you fill out a form online, like a search box, your input must be used on a database. If you are searching for something, then the website must take your input text, scan the database for that text, and then show the results to you. For the sake of an example, let us assume you searched for the phrase ‘cats’. A command in a search database might look something like the following, which searches the database for any occurrence of the word cats:</p>
	
	<p><span>Select * FROM data WHERE * LIKE “%cats%”</span></p>
	
	<p>Knowing this, we can create a phrase to search for that will break this code and allow us access to write our own commands for the database. Let’s see what happens to that command if we search for the phrase ‘ “; SELET * from passwords; –'. Then, what the server executes is:</p>
	
	<p><span>Select * FROM data WHERE * LIKE “%”; SELECT * FROM passwords; --%”</span></p>
	
	<p>The ‘--' at the end is interpreted as a comment, so the server never sees it or what comes after. The word SELECT also marks the beginning of a new command. What happens, is:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>SELECT * FROM data WHERE * LIKE “%”;</li>
		<li>SELECT * FROM passwords;</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Now we have caused the server to add a new command which fetches all the passwords. This is an SQL injection attack. We have “injected” our own command, and probably caused the owner of the website a whole lot of trouble.</p>
	
	<h2> History </h2>
	
	<p>The earliest recorded documentation of an SQL injection attack was on December 25, 1998, when Jeff Forristal, also known as Rain Forrest Puppy, wrote about the exploit in Phrack, an online cybersecurity magazine. Ironically, Microsoft did not think it was a problem, so programmers should not worry about doing anything to stop it (rain.forest.puppy, 1998). Since then, SQL injection has been among the most common vulnerabilities in websites (Cox, 2015). Still, over two decades later, SQL injection attacks are a common occurrence. Here are some of the most ironic examples of SQL injection attacks over the past two decades:</p>

	<p>Finding more examples is not hard. <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#Examples”>Wikipedia</a> has quite a long list, and it is far from comprehensive. Evidently this attack is still very prevalent and even companies we might think know to protect against it, like Microsoft themselves, fall victim. What is truly surprising then is just how easy it is to fix. </p>
	
	<h2> How to Fix </h2>
	
	<p> The easiest way to fix this problem is to sanitize the inputs. Sanitation is the process of converting an input string (like ‘cats’ or ‘ “; DELETE * from data; –‘) into a string that can be read by the computer as a single string rather than be interpreted as a second command. This is usually done by adding a ‘\’ before quotation marks. With sanitation, ‘ “; DELETE * from data; –‘ becomes ‘ \“; DELETE * from data; –‘. Then, the computer processes it as: </p>
	
	<p><span>SELECT * FROM data WHERE * LIKE “%\“; DELETE * from data; –%”</p></span>
	
	<p>This means you would be searching for the phrase “DELETE * from data” rather than running it on the database.</p>
