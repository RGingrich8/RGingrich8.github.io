	<h1>Cross Site Scripting</h1>
	
	<!--
	The way I see this working on the website is we have the user type “<script> javascript:alert(‘You have been hacked!’); </script>” into two fields. One will allow the script to run and prompt the user. The other will sanitize the input so that the alert does not show up.
	-->
	
	<h2> How to Exploit </h2>
	
	<p>Similarly, to how SQL injection works, cross-site scripting (XSS) involves exploiting user input areas to insert code into a site and run that code. On our site, we have a comment box which allows posters to use html to design their comments. However, like with SQL injection, we are not going to post just any comment. We are going to include a script. Type the following into the first comment box:</p>

	<p><span><\script>alert(‘You have been hacked!’);<\script></p></span>
	
	<p>The above code will run, and you will be prompted with the message ‘You have been hacked’. A savvy hacker can do this with a much more complicated and malicious script.</p>
	
	<h2> History </h2>
	
	<p>In the early days of the internet (the mid-90’s), websites used a lot of frames which showed other pages. One site might have a dedicated page for the main menu, and then add a frame to the top of every page that shows that menu (Grossman, 2006). Then JavaScript enabled “developers to do all sorts of crazy things like image rollovers, mouse followers and pop-up windows” (Grossman, 2006).</p>
	
	<p> Hackers soon figured out that JavaScript could load a malicious website into one of those frames or into a pop-up window. This site could then “pull data from forms, re-write the page, etc” (Grossman, 2006). Discovery cannot be attributed to a single person, but many people were taking advantage of the new flaws created by the introduction of JavaScript and working around whatever fixes web developers came up with. Like SQL injections, it is still one of the most common website vulnerabilities. According to HackerOne, cross-site scripting was the most common vulnerability exploited on their platform (Ranger, 2017).</p>

	</ol>
	
	<p>The fix here is a little bit more complicated.</p>

	<h2> How to Fix </h2>
	
	<p>There are multiple ways to fix this problem. The easiest would be to sanitize the data inputs to remove malicious code. This can be as simple as removing the “script” tags (Vigliarolo, 2018). Another way might be for the site to block third party scripts. The downside of this approach is that it could also inhibit the site’s ability to serve advertisements or collect analytics data.</p>
	
	<p>We are going to remove the script tags. Try typing the same message into comment box 2. You will see that the comment that appears does not contain the script tags. We have replaced all instances of ‘<script’ and ‘</script’ with blanks.</p>
